            Moving goods, personal items, or merchandise is always a hassle and
            the current solutions provided are not helping but are becoming a
            problem as well. Bakkiego comes in between bridging the current
            inefficient solutions and the problem of hassle movement with the
            number one solution South Africa acknowledges as the "informal
            alternative",<b>BAKKIES</b>, we all know they are flexible,
            tenacious, and always ready to help. Not only are we involving the
            local working community of these amazing movers but we are giving
            them a platform to extend their services by using their trucks which
            we all know and trust connecting formal or informal uses for a price
            both parties can agree on by themselves.
